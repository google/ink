message Version {
  // Version represents a Jetpack release of Ink, mapping directly to the
  // values associated with releases at:
  // https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/ink
  //
  // For example, Ink 1.0.0-alpha04 would be represented as:
  // ```
  // major: 1
  // minor: 0
  // bug: 0
  // cycle: CYCLE_ALPHA
  // release: 4
  // ```
  // Ink 1.0.0 would be represented as:
  // ```
  // major: 1
  // minor: 0
  // bug: 0
  // cycle: CYCLE_STABLE
  // release: 1
  // ```
  // Note that the release value is 1-based, to stay consistent with the
  // Jetpack release values. Stable releases should always have a release value
  // of 1, since we don't release multiple iterations of a stable build for a
  // given version (there is no 1.0.0-stable01, 1.0.0-stable02, etc.
  // only 1.0.0).
  //
  // Version must be compared in lexicographical order, including all 5 fields
  // (major, minor, bug, cycle, release) in that order, to establish version
  // precedence.
  //
  // Cycle and release are used to couch against instability between various
  // alpha and beta releases which change the custom brush API. Earlier releases
  // provide a guarantee that they will not load a brush containing a feature
  // from a later release. Cycle and release are necessary for this guarantee
  // to work between builds of the same major, minor, and bug valued version.
  //
  // The reverse guarantee, however, is not provided. If a brush feature is
  // introduced in an alpha release, and removed in a beta release, the beta
  // release will not reject the brush on the basis of version, instead it
  // will attempt to load the brush as-is, making a best effort with the code
  // that it has to deserialize the brush.
