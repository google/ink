// A behavior describing how stroke input properties should affect the shape and
// color of the brush tip.
//
// The behavior is conceptually a graph made from the various node types defined
// below. Each edge of the graph represents passing a nullable floating point
// value between nodes, and each node in the graph fits into one of the
// following categories:
//   1. Leaf nodes generate an output value without graph inputs. For example,
//      they can create a value from properties of stroke input.
//   2. Filter nodes can conditionally toggle branches of the graph "on" by
//      outputting their input value, or "off" by outputting a null value.
//   3. Operator nodes take in one or more input values and generate an output.
//      For example, by mapping input to output with an easing function.
//   4. Terminal nodes apply one or more input values to chosen properties of
//      the brush tip.
//
// The behavior is specified by a single list of nodes that represents a
// flattened, post-order traversal of the graph. The simplest form of behavior
// consists of two nodes:
//
//                     +--------+      +--------+
//                     | Source | ---> | Target |
//                     +--------+      +--------+
//
// This behavior would be represented by the list {Source, Target}. An example
// of such a behavior defined in C++ would be:
//
//    BrushBeahvior behavior = {
//        .nodes = {
//            BrushBehavior::SourceNode{
//                .source = BrushBehavior::Source::kPressure,
//                .source_value_range = {0.2, 0.8},
//            },
//            BrushBehavior::TargetNode{
//                .target = BrushBehavior::Target::kSizeMultiplier,
//                .target_modifier_range = {0.75, 1.25},
//            },
//        }};
//
// A more complex behavior could use two source values for a single target:
//
//             +----------+      +-----+
//             | Source 1 | ---> |     |
//             +----------+      |     |      +--------+
//                               | Max | ---> | Target |
//             +----------+      |     |      +--------+
//             | Source 2 | ---> |     |
//             +----------+      +-----+
//
// This could be represented by the list {Source 1, Source 2, Max, Target}.
//
// For each input in a stroke, `BrushTip::behaviors` are applied as follows:
//   1. A target modifier for each tip property is accumulated from every
//     `BrushBehavior` present on the current `BrushTip`:
//        * Multiple behaviors can affect the same `Target`.
//        * Depending on the `Target`, modifiers from multiple behaviors will
//          stack either additively or multiplicatively, according to the
//          descriptions on that `BrushBehavior::Target`.
//        * Regardless, the order of specified behaviors does not affect the
//          result.
//   2. The modifiers are applied to the shape and color shift values of the
//      tip's state according to the descriptions on each `Target`. The
//      resulting tip property values are then clamped or normalized to within
//      their valid range of values. E.g. the final value of
//      `BrushTip::corner_rounding` will be clamped within [0, 1].
//      Generally:
//        * The affected shape values are those found in `BrushTip` members.
//        * The color shift values remain in the range -100% to +100%. Note that
//          when stored on a vertex, the color shift is encoded such that each
//          channel is in the range [0, 1], where 0.5 represents a 0% shift.
//
// Note that the accumulated tip shape property modifiers may be adjusted by the
// implementation before being applied: The rates of change of shape properties
// may be constrained to keep them from changing too rapidly with respect to
// distance traveled from one input to the next.
