// Extrusion of a stroke:
//   * Incrementally takes a sequence of `BrushTipState`s, where each state
//     defines tip properties at one point along the stroke.
//   * For each tip state:
//       * Models the shape of the state when its width and height are both
//         greater than the brush epsilon value.
//       * Inserts a "break-point" in the geometry when the width and height of
//         the tip state are below the threshold. This allows an extruded stroke
//         to have gaps in geometry for dashes and dots.
//   * Connects the contiguous sequences of shapes with a triangle mesh, as
//     though each tip shape smoothly morphs into the next.
//
// The resulting geometry is added to a target mesh specified for the current
// stroke.
